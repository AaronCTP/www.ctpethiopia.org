# **Our Mission**

  
CTP aims to demystify the college application process to US universities by giving Ethiopian high school students the necessary training they will need to excel on the SAT exam and by offering comprehensive help with filling out the different aspects of the college application. Furthermore, CTP has a new internship platform called CTP Careers, aimed at providing a database of varied sought out companies, organizations, and start-ups that high-school students to recent college graduates can apply to and gain professional experience.

**Why Counseling is Crucial**

The American college application process is very complex. Counselors provide students with vital information and resources needed to make the college application process easier. Unfortunately, out of the hundreds of high schools, there are only three college counselors in Addis Ababa providing a huge vacuum and need for college application assistance. Through CTP we hope to alleviate this shortage and help as many high school students with applying and matriculating into American universities.

> * We offer three hour long classes three to four times a week for a period of 2 months in the summer (from June to August). During these sessions, students receive rigorous training on SAT test-taking skills and the college application process by top-of-the-line instructors from high ranking schools in the U.S. and high school seniors who recently got accepted to schools abroad.
> * â€‹We pair selected high school students with a college student who serves as a mentor and guides them through the college application process via weekly emails, feedback on personal statements, supplemental essays and assist them with deliberation and decision making after having been accepted to college.
> * Our students will have access to over 50 SAT study guides and books about the college application process and will  receive a 100 page CTP workbook that outlines all components  required in a college application in great detail.
