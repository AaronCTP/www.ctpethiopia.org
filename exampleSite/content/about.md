# **Our Mission**

  
CTP aims to demystify the college application process to US universities by giving Ethiopian high school students the necessary training they will need to excel on the SAT exam and by offering comprehensive help with filling out the different aspects of the college application. Furthermore, CTP has a new internship platform called CTP Careers, aimed at providing a database of varied sought out companies, organizations, and start-ups that high-school students to recent college graduates can apply to and gain professional experience.

**Why Counseling is Crucial**

The American college application process is very complex. Counselors provide students with vital information and resources needed to make the college application process easier. Unfortunately, out of the hundreds of high schools, there are only three college counselors in Addis Ababa providing a huge vacuum and need for college application assistance. Through CTP we hope to alleviate this shortage and help as many high school students with applying and matriculating into American universities.
